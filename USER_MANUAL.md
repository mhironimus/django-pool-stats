### Starting a new season ###

All in the admin interface:

1. Unset 'is default' on the previous season.
1. Create a new season, setting 'is_default.' Note: having 0 or 2 seasons with 'is_default' set will break a lot of things.
1. Create the divisions for the new season. Note: when creating teams, the divisions in the select menu will be for whatever is currently the season with 'is_default' set.
1. Create the weeks.
1. Create the teams. Note: you can copy and modify teams from a previous season, if they are similar enough for that to be quicker than creating them from scratch.
1. Create the matches. You're done! You have a new season.

### Managing results ###

1. Navigate to the Score Sheets section of the admin UI.
1. Filter on the season, and on Official set to No; you should now see a list of submitted score sheets. Users should have marked their score sheets as complete, but may not have.
1. Under the Links column, there is a link to the public edit and view versions of each score sheet. Use these to decide which version of a match is correct, make fixes, etc.
1. Mark each score sheet that is correct as 'official'. 
1. Delete the score sheets that are redundant/incomplete.
1. In the public/non-admin UI, from the admin menu, select 'Update team stats', and then 'Update player stats'. Each of these takes a few seconds to run.
1. You are done!
